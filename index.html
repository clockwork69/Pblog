<h3>This is a Work In Progress</h3>
<p>This page is a work in progress, and construction is estimated to take a week. Why?<p>
<p><ol>
<li>I need to do some hiking.</li>
<li>Also, cycling. My bicycle is feeling very neglected lately.</li>
<li>Last but not least, there are books to read and carpets to vacuum.</li>
</ol>
<p><p>After those are done, I will probably finish coding the first page. Yay. Toodles and see you soon.</p>
