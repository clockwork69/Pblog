<h3>This is a Work In Progress</h3>
<p>This page is a work in progress, and construction is estimated to take a week. Why?<p>
<p><ol>
<li>My HTML skills are back to n00b level</li>
<li>CSS skills = 0</li>
<li>need to figure out what I'm doing</li>
</ol>
<p><p>After those are dealt with, I will probably finish coding the first page. Yay. Toodles and see you soon.</p>
